# TCAP-VENTURES_SRIRAM

This project implements a **Bollinger Band Reversal** trading strategy with a backtesting system to analyze market performance. The project includes data ingestion, strategy execution, trade simulation, and result visualization.

## Assignment Overview

This project was developed as part of an assignment requiring the implementation of a **backtest logic for a trading strategy**. The key requirements included:

- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Fetch historical **4H/1D candle data** for at least **50 stocks/crypto** over 1 year.
  - Store the data in a **folder/database**.

- **Backtest Implementation**:
  - Assume **unlimited capital**.
  - Each trade involves purchasing **$100 worth of tokens**.
  - At the end of the backtest period, sell all holdings.

- **Trading Strategy - Bollinger Band Reversal**:
  - **BUY** when the price falls **3% below** the lower Bollinger Band.
  - **SELL** when the price reaches the **upper Bollinger Band**.

- **Backtesting Requirements**:
  - Implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
  - Generate a **DataFrame** where each row represents a trade with the columns:
    - `token`, `date_in`, `buy_price`, `date_out`, `sell_price`, `profit_percentage`
  - Save the results in a CSV file.
  - Develop a **web application** to visualize trading signals and performance.

## Project Structure


This project implements a trading strategy utilizing Bollinger Bands to identify potential buy and sell signals in stock market data. The strategy is backtested to evaluate its performance over historical data.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script that orchestrates data processing, strategy execution, and result visualization.
- `backtest.py`: Contains functions and classes responsible for backtesting the trading strategy.
- `strategy.py`: Defines the trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands.
- `sriram.py`: Additional script for data analysis or utility functions.
- `data/`: Directory containing input data files used for backtesting.
- `templates/`: Directory for HTML templates, possibly used for generating reports or dashboards.
- `bollinger_bands.png`: Image illustrating the Bollinger Bands for a particular stock.
- `output window.mp4`: Video demonstrating the application's output or user interface.
- `signals.csv`: CSV file listing the buy and sell signals generated by the strategy.
- `trade_results.csv`: CSV file summarizing the results of executed trades during backtesting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- flask (if a web interface is implemented)

Install the required packages using:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib flask
